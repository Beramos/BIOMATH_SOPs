## Definitions
* __Conference__: Participatory meeting designed for discussion, fact-finding, problem solving and consultation. As compared with a congress, a conference is normally smaller in scale and more select in character - features which tend to facilitate the exchange of information. The term "conference" carries no special connotation as to frequency. Though not inherently limited in time, conferences are usually of limited duration with specific objectives.
* __Congress__: Regular coming together on a representational basis of several hundreds - or even thousands - of individuals belonging to a single professional, cultural, religious or other group. A congress is often convened to discuss a particular subject. Contributions to the presentation and discussion of the subject matter come only from members of the organising body. 
* __CWO__: The faculty's scientific research comitee which provides financial support to researchers for their active participation in congresses with international renown. Each year this comission gest a budget allocated from the UGent to send young researchers to conferences. 
* __FWO__: The flemish fund for scientific research. This governemental organisation also provides funds for attending conferences. However, to date they require that you have at least one scientific publication before they grant any funding.

## Responsibilities
__You__ are responsible for keeping track of all your expenses before and during your attendance (i.e. transport, accomodation, food).

## Procedure
Attending (inter)national conference to disseminate our work is part of the job. Loads of conferences are organized every year, the challange is to find one that fits your specialisation. The easiest way of finding out about interesting conferences is by just asking your supervisor and colleagues, most likely they know which are most informative for your work. However, you can always propose your supervisor(s) to attend a "new" conference, just communicate this with them. 

### _Before the conference_
* :exclamation: The faculty's policy requires that you should do a paralell submission to the Flemish fund for scientific research (FWO). However, the FWO requires you to do this at least __3 months up front__. If you forget to apply in time the CWO is not obliged to consider your application. So make sure you keep track of timing!
* Make sure to apply for a travel application for any work related travels outside the 300 km perifery of Ghent with at least one night out (Dutch: reisaanvraag) (`Timpe for more information`).

### _During the conference_
Keep track of your expensens (`all vs. one meal a day: ASK TIMPE`).

### _After the conference_
As soon as you are back from your conference. You should send the proof of your expenses (`original vs. scan: ASK TIMPE`) to the secretary responsible for them to take not of this and transfer the money back to your bank account.
