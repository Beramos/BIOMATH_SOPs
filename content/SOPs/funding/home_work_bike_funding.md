## Purpose

This SOP deals with the procedures to apply for reimbursement when you use the bike as the main transportation to your work. Only staff from UGent can apply for this (includes PhD students). It involves 2 steps:

* Registration of a valid bike route (which has to be approved by DPO staff)
* Registration of the days that you use the bike.

The reimbursement is done automatically in your monthly salary using 0,20â‚¬/km.

2. `Personeel>Mijn gegevens>` and click on `Woon-Werk` tab.

3. In `Traject woon-wekverkeer` click on  <font color="red">Nieuw traject toevoegen</font>.

4. A new screen with four steps will appear. 
    1. Click `Start`. 
    2. Select the day where you wish to start registering the bike days in _Vanaf_. 
    3. In _Hoofdtraject_ select your main transportation (_FIETS_).
    4. In _vertrekadres_ introduce your departure address. 
    5. In _Eindadres_ introduce the final address (eg. Coupure Links 653, Ghent (Faculteit Bio-ingenieurswetenschappen).
    6. Continue by clicking `Volgende stap`.
    7. The details will be shown. If you want to accept them `Verzenden`, if not `Vorige stap`. 
    8. Confirm your request.

5. If everything went ok, In `Woon-Werk` tab it should appear the following: "<font color="red">_Er is een lopende aanvraag voor uw woon-werkverkeer die nog door DPO dient goedgekeurd te worden._</font>" Which informs you that **your request is pending for DPO approval**. You might also receive an email in your Ugent account informing you that your bike route is succesfully submitted.

6. Check the `Woon-Werk` tab to see if your bike route is approved.

### _Registration of days_

1. In *Apollo* go to `Personeel>Kalender` and `Maand` tab.

2. Select a day or make a span of the days you wish to register. A yellow window will appear and click `fietsdag`. If the DPO staff did not accept your request, you should be poped-up informing you that no bike route is available.

3. A screen will appear
    1. With the dates in _Wanneer_.
    2. Choose the bike route in _Voor_.
    3. In _Aantal kilometer_, DPO staff will calculate you the distance.
    4. You can write in _Comentaar_ if you wish to inform your department leader that you are using a bike.
    5. Click `Aanvraag indienen` to submit your request
    6. You should receive a pop-up with "_Uw registratie is scuccesvol ingediend_".

4. The registered cycling days are displayed in the calendar in _Maand_ with a red icon <font color="red"> (?) Gefietste dag</font>. You can click this icon to see the details.

:exclamation: 5. **Important**: At the end of each month, you shoud make your definitive request by using the Action Menu at the left hand side of the calendar (_Definitieve fietsregistratie_). A pop-up will display asking for confirmation. Be careful, **once you have used this action button you are not allowed to do more registrations or changes**.

### _Notes_

-   Bike days can only be registered in the **two previous months and the current month**;

-   You cannot register bike days in the future, during holidays and weekends.

-   To delete registered cycling days (without the ?), you should contact the DPO helpdesk.

-   You can only register them when the DPO already approved your bike route (Check it on *Apollo* in _Mijn gegevens>Woon-werk_)

**PRO TIP**:You can also span the entire month to register cycling days, and then remove the days when you did not use the bike.

**PRO TIP for the head of department/group **: You can delegate your authority  to one of your employees. More information can be found on [HR Delegations](http://www.saphelp.ugent.be/Apollo/InfoPak/nav/personeel/hr%20delegaties/file3/index.htm).
