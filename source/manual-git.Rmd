If you prefer a visual interface to git...

1. Install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
2. [Configure git](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/getting-started/configuring-git-for-github-desktop/)
3. Follow [this tutorial](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop/) to clone your repo

## Clone a repo to work locally with the command line

If you prefer working on the command line...

1. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
2. [Configure git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/)
3. Follow [this tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) to clone your repo

---

## Make a commit

1. Open your favourite text editor
2. Update the `README.md`
3. Commit your changes

---

![Local commit](manual-git/local-commit.png)

## Push your changes to backup your work

* GitHub Desktop: click `Sync`
* Command line: `git push origin master`
* Go to your repo on GitHub to verify

---

![Verify your commits on GitHub](manual-git/local-commit-on-github.png)

---

## Create logical commits

1. Make 2 unrelated changes to your `README.md` locally
2. Create one commit for each change. For command line: `git add -p README.md`
3. Do not push (yet)

---

![Logical commit 1](manual-git/logical-commit-1.png)

---

![Logical commit 2](manual-git/logical-commit-2.png)

## Create a conflict

1. Update your `README.md` on GitHub, on a line you also edited locally

![Commit to create conflict](manual-git/commit-to-create-conflict.png)

---

## Conflict!

1. Try to push your local changes

![Conflict](manual-git/conflict.png)

---

## Keep calm and resolve conflict

1. Open in text editor:

        <<<<<<< HEAD
        A simple analysis to visualize my favourite fruit colour.
        =======
        A simple analysis to discover my favourite fruit color.
        >>>>>>> origin/master

2. Choose what you want to keep:

        A simple analysis to discover my favourite fruit colour.

3. Commit and push

---

*Unreviewed below*

---
## The story of your project
* Add a new file to your repository
* `git diff` and `git status` the changes
* `git commit` the addition of the new file
* Adapt your `README.md` again in two different sections
* `git diff` and `git status` the changes
* `git commit` these changes in two separate commits

---
* Apparently, a small typo in the last commit
* `git amend` the typo to your last commit

---
* Backup - `git push` - your local work to Github

## Travel back in time
* Explore your `git log`
* Explore the `log` on Github and write down the HASH of your fist commit

* **Linux user Tip:** Add an alias to your `.bash_aliases`:
```
alias glog="git log --graph --pretty=format:'%C(bold)%h%Creset%C(magenta)%d%Creset %s %C(yellow)<%an> %C(cyan)(%cr)%Creset' --abbrev-commit --date=relative"
```

---
Exploration from history (READ-ONLY)
* `git checkout` to your first commit
* Check the local folder and files on your computer
* `git checkout master` to your latest work again

---
Undo when not yet commit 
* Change a value in your data file
* Save the file
* Undo this change `git checkout -- datafilename`

---
Undo when already commit
* Change a value in any of your files
* Save the file
* `git commit` your adaptation
* `git revert HEAD` (go back one commit)
* Check the file again

**Remark:** `git revert` can be applied to any commit, more in depth information about undoing of commits is given in LINK TO MD TODO

---
## Experiment with changes

* Create a branch (`git checkout -b myfeaturebranch`)
* Get an overview of your branches `git branch`
* `git add` a file to the repository
* Go back to the status of the master (`git checkout master`)
* Verify your local folder structure (where is the file?)
* Go back to the status of the new branch (`git checkout myfeaturebranch`)

---
Merge branches
* Go back to the status of the master (`git checkout master`)
* `git merge myfeaturebranch` to the master branch 
* Verify your local folder structure (where is the file?)
* Delete the `myfeaturebranch` (`git branch -d myfeaturebranch`)

---
A branch is a label to a commit
* Restart experimenting from a previous commit: `git checkout -b oldstate 0d1d7fc32`
* Backup this branch to GitHub (`git push origin oldstate`)

---
## Exclude files

Passwords and large files need to be excluded from the version control!

* Go to master branch `git checkout master`
* Create a new file `password.txt` with the words `SECRET`
* `git status` and `git diff`
* Adapt `.gitignore` to exclude the `password.txt` file
* `git status` and `git diff`
* `git commit` your adaptation to the `.gitignore` file
* `git push` your changes to GitHub
* Verify the `.gitignore` file on GitHub

---
# Working together

## Teaming up
* Team up with two or three persons
* Let one person invite the others, provide them with read/write access as explained in [this tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/)

## Online collaboration
* All raise an issue online
* provide these issues with an appropriate label

---
* Make an adaptation to an online file
* Propose a `pull request` and assign your collaborator
* Merge the adaptation to the `master` branch

## Working local - merging online

* As collaborator, `git clone` the other repository to your local computer
* Create each a new branch with a different name (`git checkout -b mybranchname`)
* Adapt the content of a file
* `git commit` your adaptation
* `git push origin mybranchname` to the remote location
* Go to GitHub and make a `pull request`
* Revise eachother work and **mege online** when appropriate

---
Update your local work
* Locally, go to master branch `git checkout master`
* Get the remote work `git fetch origin`
* Update your local master `git merge --ff-only origin/master`
* Check if all adaptations are represented in your local files

---
