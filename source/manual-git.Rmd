# Personal workflow

---
## Backup your work
* Create your own repository online
* Connect your local Git with Github

```
git config -- global user.name 'Your Name Here'
git config -- global user.email 'email@example.com'
```
* `git clone` to your computer

---
* Adapt your `README.md` on Github
* Adapt your `README.md` local
* `git push/pull` your local changes
* CONFLICT!?!

---
## The story of your project
* Add a new file to your repository
* `git diff` and `git status` the changes
* `git commit` the addition of the new file
* Adapt your `README.md` again in two different sections
* `git diff` and `git status` the changes
* `git commit` these changes in two separate commits

---
* Apparently, a small typo in the last commit
* `git amend` the typo to your last commit

---
* Backup - `git push` - your local work to Github

## Travel back in time
* Check your git
