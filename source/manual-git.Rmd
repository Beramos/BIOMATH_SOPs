## Make a commit

...

---


## Push your changes to backup your work

---

## Create a conflict

1. Adapt your `README.md` on GitHub
2. Adapt your `README.md` locally
3. `git push/pull` your local changes
4. CONFLICT!?!

---
## The story of your project
* Add a new file to your repository
* `git diff` and `git status` the changes
* `git commit` the addition of the new file
* Adapt your `README.md` again in two different sections
* `git diff` and `git status` the changes
* `git commit` these changes in two separate commits

---
* Apparently, a small typo in the last commit
* `git amend` the typo to your last commit

---
* Backup - `git push` - your local work to Github

## Travel back in time
* Explore your `git log`
* Explore the `log` on Github and write down the HASH of your fist commit

* **Linux user Tip:** Add an alias to your `.bash_aliases`:
```
alias glog="git log --graph --pretty=format:'%C(bold)%h%Creset%C(magenta)%d%Creset %s %C(yellow)<%an> %C(cyan)(%cr)%Creset' --abbrev-commit --date=relative"
```

---
Exploration from history (READ-ONLY)
* `git checkout` to your first commit
* Check the local folder and files on your computer
* `git checkout master` to your latest work again

---
Undo when not yet commit 
* Change a value in your data file
* Save the file
* Undo this change `git checkout -- datafilename`

---
Undo when already commit
* Change a value in any of your files
* Save the file
* `git commit` your adaptation
* `git revert HEAD` (go back one commit)
* Check the file again

**Remark:** `git revert` can be applied to any commit, more in depth information about undoing of commits is given in LINK TO MD TODO

---
## Experiment with changes

* Create a branch (`git checkout -b myfeaturebranch`)
* Get an overview of your branches `git branch`
* `git add` a file to the repository
* Go back to the status of the master (`git checkout master`)
* Verify your local folder structure (where is the file?)
* Go back to the status of the new branch (`git checkout myfeaturebranch`)

---
Merge branches
* Go back to the status of the master (`git checkout master`)
* `git merge myfeaturebranch` to the master branch 
* Verify your local folder structure (where is the file?)
* Delete the `myfeaturebranch` (`git branch -d myfeaturebranch`)

---
A branch is a label to a commit
* Restart experimenting from a previous commit: `git checkout -b oldstate 0d1d7fc32`
* Backup this branch to GitHub (`git push origin oldstate`)

---
## Exclude files

Passwords and large files need to be excluded from the version control!

* Go to master branch `git checkout master`
* Create a new file `password.txt` with the words `SECRET`
* `git status` and `git diff`
* Adapt `.gitignore` to exclude the `password.txt` file
* `git status` and `git diff`
* `git commit` your adaptation to the `.gitignore` file
* `git push` your changes to GitHub
* Verify the `.gitignore` file on GitHub
